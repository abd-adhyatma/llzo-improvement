## Abstract
Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (LLZO) is hailed as one of the most promising electrolytes for solid-state Li-ion batteries. However, numerous viable doping strategies add further design complexities to the developmental process. Nowadays, the dawn of machine learning methods brings a possible solution to efficiently traverse the vast design space of doped LLZO. In this work, we develop a machine learning model to classify the ionic conductivity of doped LLZO using features derived from molecular, structural, and electronic descriptors. Meticulous model selection, validation, and optimization processes yielded a classifier based on the LightGBM algorithm with a leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy score of 0.903. Three key aspects were identified as the critical factors to obtaining doped LLZO with high ionic conductivity, namely the electrolyte's relative density, the Li site dopant’s electronegativity, and the Zr site dopant’s ionic radius. Overall, this study illustrates the role of powerful data-driven methods with easily obtainable features in accelerating the process of novel solid-state electrolyte design.
